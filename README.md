# Information-extraction-NLP-project
Information extraction on articles is the automated retrieval of specific information such as keywords or even the main topic of a body or bodies of abstract text.

In this project, we are going to categorize the collected texts using machine learning algorithms. For this purpose, we use the database containing abstracts of articles and their topics. This dataset includes the following two classes.

1: Topics related to Twitter, Facebook and YouTube social networks.

0: topics not related to social networks
